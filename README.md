# Automated Phishing Detection and Response System

This project simulates a phishing attack environment where the tool automatically detects, analyzes, and responds to phishing emails or web requests. It leverages NLP techniques (using libraries like NLTK or spaCy) for text analysis, correlates incident data, and simulates automated responses such as alerting or isolating affected accounts. An incident report is generated to document the analysis, mitigation steps, and response actions.

## Key Components
- **Detection Engine:** Analyzes email subjects, bodies, and URLs to identify phishing patterns.
- **Incident Correlation:** Integrates detection results with email logs to highlight suspicious activity.
- **Automated Response & Mitigation:** Simulates actions like isolating users and sending alerts.
- **Documentation & Reporting:** Generates a detailed JSON report summarizing each incident.
